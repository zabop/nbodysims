# N-body simulation code in C++

The code here was prepared for submission during my Physics course in Cambridge, in early 2018. The original code which I developed can be found [here](https://www.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk/lester/teaching/Computing2017/www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/teaching/comput/C++/solutions/planet2/index.shtml).

## TLDR:
For two stars orbiting each other, initial conditions resulting in circular orbit:
C++ code: `firsttrials.cc`, then visualize with `firsttrials.py`, followed by `ffmpeg -framerate 24 -i firsttrials%03d.png firsttrials.mp4`. Result:
